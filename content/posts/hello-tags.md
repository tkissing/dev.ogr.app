# Tags - for a reason

As you can see, I added tags to my posts here. At the moment of me writing this all posts have the same tags, `hugo` and `ogr` because they all are in a sense about this blog and my experience learning Hugo.

However, this should change soon as I started a new project. I am still in the process of deciding on some tech stack details and setting up everything, but I can already share that the Github repo lives at [tkissing/tiled-up](https://github.com/tkissing/tiled-up).

The main goal for me with that project is to get some practical experience using Go beyond the little templating I do for this blog, but I also hope that the code I write to learn can turn into the basis of a game. I have long wanted to make a gamne, even if I end up being the only one playing it. While the actual game might be single player, I want the architecture at least support multiplayer, so TiledUp will consist of a server written in Go and a web client written in Typescript. Communication between the client and server will probably be done via websocket only.
