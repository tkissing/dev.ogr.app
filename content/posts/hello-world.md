# Introduction

My name is Timo and I have been a Software Engineer by trade for over 20 years now. My first coding experiences reach back even further, some time in the late 80s or early 90s when I edited Basic code and memory contents of games on my Commodore C64.

If all goes to plan, over the next few months this blog and the associated Github repository will document my journey in learning [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Go](https://go.dev) as well as refreshing my knowledge about modern CSS and JavaScript.

At least for a while, each post will line up with one commit in the git repo, giving a deeper explanation of the "why" and describing how I arrived at my solution and what problems I had to deal with.

# Getting started

The first step in this project was the creation of the repository on Github. There is nothing special here, it's a public repository with a `Go` oriented `.gitignore` file generated by Github.

## Using Hugo to generate a starter site

After cloning the repo I generated a basic Hugo project.

```bash
lino@WIN-NEUTRON:~/github$ hugo new site dev.ogr.app/ --force -f yaml
Congratulations! Your new Hugo site is created in /home/lino/github/dev.ogr.app.

Just a few more steps and you're ready to go:

1. Download a theme into the same-named folder.
   Choose a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/ or
   create your own with the "hugo new theme <THEMENAME>" command.
2. Perhaps you want to add some content. You can add single files
   with "hugo new <SECTIONNAME>/<FILENAME>.<FORMAT>".
3. Start the built-in live server via "hugo server".

Visit https://gohugo.io/ for quickstart guide and full documentation.
```

For Hugo to work and be able to generate HTML pages from this Markdown document I am writing here, it needs a few files called `layouts`. While I could create these manually in the `layouts` folder at the roof of the project, it seems better to have them in a custom theme. As Hugo pointed out after creating the site for me. it can also help me generate a theme that includes some of the files I will need, so did just that.

```bash
lino@WIN-NEUTRON:~/github/dev.ogr.app$ hugo new theme dev-ogr
Creating theme at /home/lino/github/dev.ogr.app/themes/dev-ogr
lino@WIN-NEUTRON:~/github/dev.ogr.app$ ls -R themes/dev-ogr/
themes/dev-ogr/:
LICENSE  archetypes  layouts  static  theme.toml

themes/dev-ogr/archetypes:
default.md

themes/dev-ogr/layouts:
404.html  _default  index.html  partials

themes/dev-ogr/layouts/_default:
baseof.html  list.html  single.html

themes/dev-ogr/layouts/partials:
footer.html  head.html  header.html

themes/dev-ogr/static:
css  js

themes/dev-ogr/static/css:

themes/dev-ogr/static/js:
```

Next I created the very file you are reading right now. Technically I created the Markdown file, but you are probably reading some HTML file generated from that, but you get my point.

```bash
lino@WIN-NEUTRON:~/github/dev.ogr.app$ hugo new posts/hello-world.md
Content "/home/lino/github/dev.ogr.app/content/posts/hello-world.md" created
```

After typing in the above content, I was curious to see if the empty theme I had created would already contain enough code to actually render the index page of the site. To find, I started the Hugo development server.

```bash
lino@WIN-NEUTRON:~/github/dev.ogr.app$ hugo server -D

```

As you can see in above output, a few layout files were still missing, so opening my Hugo site in a browser at this point only gave me a blank page.

## Creating the first layouts

The Hugo Layouts Lookup Rules mentioned here are explained in the Hugo docs at https://gohugo.io/templates/lookup-order/ and some of those files exist already in the right place in the
theme folder created earlier. For Hugo to actually use the theme, a simple addition of

```yaml
# config.yaml
theme: dev-ogr
```

to the `config.yaml` file was all that's needed.

To keep it simple, the first iteration of the `Home` page layout just lists all posts with their title and a summary.

```html
<!-- themes/dev-ogr/layouts/index.html -->
{{ define "main" }}
    <div id="index-page">
        {{ range .Site.RegularPages }}
            <section class="item">
                <h2><a href='{{ .RelPermalink }}'>{{ .Title }}</a></h2>
                <div class="summary">{{ .Summary }}</div>
            </section>
        {{ end }}
    </div>
{{ end }}
```

The result does not look pretty yet, but it works.

![Very simple view of this blog post in development](/images/hello-world-home-page.png)

Last, but not least I created a simple layout for individual posts to make the links from the `Home` page work.

```html
<!-- themes/dev-ogr/layouts/single.html -->
{{ define "main" }}
    <section class="single">
        <h1>{{ .Title }}</h1>
        <div class="content">{{ .Content }}</div>
    </section>
{{ end }}
```

After confirming in the browser that both the home page and the individual post view look fine, I let Hugo generate all the files needed to deploy this iteration of the dev.ogr.app blog.

```bash
lino@WIN-NEUTRON:~/github/dev.ogr.app$ hugo
