# Reboot

For reasons I do not want to go into here yet, I am looking into a career change and Go is used at multiple companies that I would be interested in working for, so my first step towards learning go is to revive this failed attempt at a dev blog.

As originally planned, I will improve the UI and the feature set of this Hugo-powered blog and document my progress. However, I will no longer go into all the detail I used in [Hello World]({{<ref "hello-world" >}}). Instead I will only document interesting (to me), larger changes.

Additionally I might post some observations and code snippets from other projects I am working on.

The goal is to post at least once a week.
