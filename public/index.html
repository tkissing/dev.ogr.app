<p>For reasons I do not want to go into here yet, I am looking into a career change and Go is used at multiple companies that I would be interested in working for, so my first step towards learning go is to revive this failed attempt at a dev blog.</p>
<p>As originally planned, I will improve the UI and the feature set of this Hugo-powered blog and document my progress. However, I will no longer go into all the detail I used in <a href="http://example.org/posts/hello-world/">Hello World</a>. Instead I will only document interesting (to me), larger changes.</p></div>

<p>My name is Timo and I have been a Software Engineer by trade for over 20 years now. My first coding experiences reach back even further, some time in the late 80s or early 90s when I edited Basic code and memory contents of games on my Commodore C64.</p>
<p>If all goes to plan, over the next few months this blog and the associated Github repository will document my journey in learning <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and <a href="https://go.dev">Go</a> as well as refreshing my knowledge about modern CSS and JavaScript.</p></div>
