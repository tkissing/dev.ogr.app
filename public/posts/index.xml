      <description>Reboot For reasons I do not want to go into here yet, I am looking into a career change and Go is used at multiple companies that I would be interested in working for, so my first step towards learning go is to revive this failed attempt at a dev blog.
As originally planned, I will improve the UI and the feature set of this Hugo-powered blog and document my progress.</description>

      <description>Introduction My name is Timo and I have been a Software Engineer by trade for over 20 years now. My first coding experiences reach back even further, some time in the late 80s or early 90s when I edited Basic code and memory contents of games on my Commodore C64.
If all goes to plan, over the next few months this blog and the associated Github repository will document my journey in learning Hugo and Go as well as refreshing my knowledge about modern CSS and JavaScript.</description>
