      Hello Tags (Mar 10, 2025)
    </h1>

    <div class="my-2"><h1 id="tags---for-a-reason">Tags - for a reason</h1>
<p>As you can see, I added tags to my posts here. At the moment of me writing this all posts have the same tags, <code>hugo</code> and <code>ogr</code> because they all are in a sense about this blog and my experience learning Hugo.</p>
<p>However, this should change soon as I started a new project. I am still in the process of deciding on some tech stack details and setting up everything, but I can already share that the Github repo lives at <a href="https://github.com/tkissing/tiled-up">tkissing/tiled-up</a>.</p>
<p>The main goal for me with that project is to get some practical experience using Go beyond the little templating I do for this blog, but I also hope that the code I write to learn can turn into the basis of a game. I have long wanted to make a gamne, even if I end up being the only one playing it. While the actual game might be single player, I want the architecture at least support multiplayer, so TiledUp will consist of a server written in Go and a web client written in Typescript. Communication between the client and server will probably be done via websocket only.</p>
