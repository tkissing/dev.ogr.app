  <h1>Reboot (Mar 3, 2025)</h1>
  <div class="content"><h1 id="reboot">Reboot</h1>
<p>For reasons I do not want to go into here yet, I am looking into a career change and Go is used at multiple companies that I would be interested in working for, so my first step towards learning go is to revive this failed attempt at a dev blog.</p>
<p>As originally planned, I will improve the UI and the feature set of this Hugo-powered blog and document my progress. However, I will no longer go into all the detail I used in <a href="http://example.org/posts/hello-world/">Hello World</a>. Instead I will only document interesting (to me), larger changes.</p>
<p>Additionally I might post some observations and code snippets from other projects I am working on.</p>
<p>The goal is to post at least once a week.</p>
